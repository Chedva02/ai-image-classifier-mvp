# Project Context & Rules

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3.10+
- AI / ML: PyTorch, torchvision
- Backend: FastAPI
- Frontend (UI): React (separate frontend project)
- Model Type: Image classification (CNN, fine-tuned pretrained model)
- Database: None (stateless MVP, no persistence required)

## Architecture Rules
1. All AI logic (training, inference, preprocessing) must be isolated under a dedicated `ai/` or `ml/` module.
2. The backend (FastAPI) is responsible only for API endpoints, input validation, and calling the AI inference layer.
3. The frontend (React) must not contain any AI or business logic — it only consumes backend APIs.
4. Training code and inference code must be clearly separated (no training logic inside API runtime).
5. Do not hardcode file paths, model weights, or configuration values — use config files or environment variables.

## Style Guide
- Naming Convention: snake_case for Python, camelCase for React
- Code Organization:
  - Training scripts live under `training/`
  - Inference code lives under `inference/`
  - API routes live under `api/`
- Prefer clear, readable code over premature optimization
- Avoid over-engineering — this is an MVP
## Project Structure

- The project is written in Python.
- Use a standard Python backend structure.
- Application code must reside under `app/`:
  - `app/main.py`
  - `app/routers/`
  - `app/services/`
  - `app/models/`
- Do not place business logic in the root directory.
